# Sweeft Acceleration / React II Step

This is my project for the second stage of Sweeft React internship. I have created everything that was demanded by the Sweeft team. I have used several librarys for the project, but as requested I have not used any library for the scroll and I fetched data 3 times by using different URLs, despite the fact that some of the data was the same and reusable. I have used Axios, react router, uuid and Redux. I know that for this small project Redux may be overkill and Context Api may be easier to set up, but I wanted to show that I know how to use Redux as well. I wanted to change design but as it was not requested I recreated design as well. I have uploaded all the necessary files and Package.json is also provided. I am sorry for the same pictures of animals but API gave me same random pictures for all of them.
